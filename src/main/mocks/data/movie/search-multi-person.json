On October 5, 2000, the series debuted on The WB to widespread critical acclaim and remained a tent-pole to the WB until it was cancelled in its seventh season, ending on May 15, 2007 on The CW. The entire series has been released on DVD, as well as on iTunes.\n\nThe show follows single mother Lorelai Gilmore and her daughter, also named Lorelai but who prefers to be called Rory, living in the fictional town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut, a town filled with colorful characters, located approximately 30 minutes from Hartford, Connecticut. Ambition, education, and work constitute part of the series' central concerns, telling Lorelai's story from pregnant teen runaway and high school dropout to co-owner and manager of the Dragonfly Inn. Rory's transition from public school to the prestigious Chilton is similarly followed, exploring her ambition to study at an Ivy League college and to become a foreign correspondent. The show's social commentary manifests most clearly in Lorelai's difficult relationship with her wealthy, appearances-obsessed parents, Emily and Richard Gilmore, and in the interactions between the students at Chilton, and later, Yale University.",

A Filmways production created by writer Paul Henning, it is the first in a genre of \"fish out of water\" themed television shows, and was followed by other Henning-inspired country-cousin series on CBS. In 1963, Henning introduced Petticoat Junction, and in 1965 he reversed the rags to riches model for Green Acres. The show paved the way for later culture-conflict programs such as The Jeffersons, McCloud, The Nanny, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, and Doc. Panned by many entertainment critics of its time, it quickly became a huge ratings success for most of its nine-year run on CBS.\n\nThe Beverly Hillbillies ranked among the top twenty most watched programs on television for eight of its nine seasons, twice ranking as the number one series of the year, with a number of episodes that remain among the most watched television episodes of all time.\n\nThe ongoing popularity of the series spawned a 1993 film remake by 20th Century Fox.",
